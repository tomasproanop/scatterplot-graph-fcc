# Scatterplot Graph - freeCodeCamp 
Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph - 2nd Data Visualization Project from freeCodeCamp 

In the Data Visualization Certification, I learned to build charts, graphs and maps to present 
different types of data with the D3.js library.

I also learned about JSON and how to work with data online using an API.
